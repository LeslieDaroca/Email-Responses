Hi **Anne**,

Thanks for reaching out. I know how much you wanted to join the summer interview prep course, and I’m really sorry to say that we can’t accept your application this time. The deadline has already passed, and with the class filled and a long waitlist, we just don’t have any spots left.

I realize this must be disappointing, especially since you’re graduating this spring and won’t have the chance to reapply next year. To help with your internship applications after graduation, I’m sharing our [high-level software interview guide](http://tinyurl.com/codepathinterviewguide)—it’s full of useful tips and advice, and I hope it’ll be a good resource for you.

Also, I’d recommend signing up for our mailing list if you haven’t already. We often share details about virtual events or other programs that you might find helpful in the future.

Thank you again for your interest and for reaching out—I really wish we had better news for you. Best of luck with your graduation and everything that’s ahead!

Best regards,

**Leslie from CodePath Admissions**
