Hello **Dennis**, 

I appreciate you getting in touch. We recognize that approximately three weeks ago, you fulfilled all of the prerequisites for the tech fellow. Although we recognize that you are eager to begin the program, we are still looking for another tech fellow applicant because the standards must be met by at least two tech fellow applicants from the same school. We kindly ask for your patience as the waiting procedure could take nearly a month. As soon as we find another tech fellow who will be able to complete the requirements, we will get back to you.
